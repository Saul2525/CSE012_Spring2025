    Week 1 Coding Assignment: Homie's Adventure
    This module simulates a simple text-based adventure game where the
    character encounters monsters, finds potions, and navigates
    based on user input.

# Declaring Variables
# Used to store important information.
# The name of our character, their initial and current health, if they have a sword, etc.

# Introduction
# The "story," if you're being generous. I used a couple of f-strings because
# it's easier to type out, especially when using variables.
INTRO = (
    f"{CHARACTER_NAME}, after having one of the most vivid nightmares of his life, "
    f"awoke in a cold sweat. Rather than awakening in his bed, he found himself in a crop circle,\n"
    f"surrounded by towering walls of wheat, with no earthly idea of how he had gotten there. "
    f"Despite feeling disoriented and nauseated, he noticed a path forwardâ€”his \"way out.\""
)
print(INTRO + "\n")

# Arithmetic Operations
# Using the variables declared earlier, I changed the values of base HEALTH
# and STRENGTH by subtracting and adding it with HEALTH_DECREASE and STRENGTH_BOOST respectively.
# I also printed messages explaining what happened with Homie's HEALTH and STRENGTH.
HEALTH -= HEALTH_DECREASE

print(
    f"Strength increased to {STRENGTH} because {CHARACTER_NAME}"

# Input and Output
# Rather than use if-elif-else statements, I decided to use a match-case statement,
# which is just a switch-case statement in Java.
# Also, I was just thinking about something fun to write about here.
